Information Systems project by Group Fourteen for the course INFS2608 at the
University of New South Wales.

## Overview
“Neddit” is a web-based concept that offers a forum for peer-to-peer learning
derived from authenticated user-generated content. Distinct from existing
services, Neddit provides value-adding insights into coursework and academic
student life for UNSW communities by creating an accessible platform for current
students, staff and UNSW alumni across degree disciplines and years of study to
create discussions based on student experiences. The authentication of users and
content is verified via user reviews of shared resources and discussion points,
with a voting system which allows the most relevant and insightful posts to be
voted up. Hence, the core features of Neddit entails uploading user-generated
content and different user types; general users, top contributors and moderators.

## The Team
Group Fourteen comprises of five university students with disciplines in Commerce,
Marketing, Information Systems and Computer Science:
- Irene Dao - Project Head
- Justin Yap - Business & Requirements Analyst
- Katherine Chen - Marketing & Design
- Malin Wijesuriya - Business & Requirements Analyst
- Weilon Ying - Software Engineer & Architect

## Disclaimer
This is a university software project build for the sole purpose of prototyping
a hypothetical crowdsourcing tool for the students of University of New South Wales.

Neddit is not an actual website, and is not affiliated with the University of
New South Wales in any shape or form. It was also implemented by mostly one person
over the course of two weeks with a lot of Googling, tears and elbow grease.
